Micrograph is a library for developing large GraphQL applications with complex business logic. Micrograph generalizes root queries and root mutations across every type in your data model. In other words, you can bootstrap a pretty large GraphQL application by writing a few functions. Afterwords, you can continue to add/modify types in your data model without adding and linking GraphQL-specific object types.
