\nMicrograph\nGithub\n \nMicrograph is a small (~375 LOC) library that makes developing large GraphQL applications with complex business logic pretty easy. Micrograph generalizes root queries and root mutations across every type in your data model. In other words, you can bootstrap a pretty large GraphQL application by writing a few functions. Afterwords, you can continue to add/modify types in your data model without adding and linking GraphQL-specific object types.\nMicrograph supports middleware hooks so that you can easily intercept queries and mutations:\nimport { createMiddleware } from 'micrograph';\n\nconst middleware = createMiddleware();\n\nmiddleware.before('createUser', (args, ctx, next) {\n  if (!isAuthenticated(ctx.req.headers.authorization)) {\n    throw new Error('Unauthorized');\n  }\n\n  next();\n});\n\nexport default middleware;\n\nMicrograph is still in beta and the API may change over time. I've used it in production, but I generally don't recommend it until the API completely stabilizes.\nThe gist \nMicrograph requires the creation of two files: schema.js and queries.js. You can optionally create two more files: mutations.js and middleware.js. The tutorial explains creating these files. Micrograph compiles these files into a GraphQLSchema that can be plugged into your favorite GraphQL server library. These files enable your application to grow by focusing on things that matter, such as middleware and schema types.\nFor example, let's say your data model includes users and blogs. You'll define your schema, create some root queries and mutations, and specify some middleware. A week later, you decide to add more types to your data model. With Micrograph, you simply need to edit your schema.js and add some more middleware hooks if you choose. You don't need to add more root queries or root mutations - Micrograph automatically takes care of that.\n\nYour app's complexity can grow without worrying about creating new GraphQL input types, object types, etc.\nGetting started \nFirst, install the Micrograph package. Micrograph relies on the cohere schema library, so install that as well. cohere is a simple ~250 LOC schema lib.\nnpm install micrograph cohere graphql --save\n\nNow, we need to define the schema, queries, mutations, and middleware. These steps are outlined in the tutorial.\nDocumentation \n\nTutorial\nDefine your business-logic layer\nDefine your schema\nRoot queries and mutations\nMiddleware\nWire everything together\n\n\nData modeling\nAPI\ncompile\ncreateMiddleware\n\n\n\n"},"tutorial.html":{"url":"tutorial.html","title":"Tutorial","keywords":"","body":"Tutorial\nThe tutorial assumes that you're familiar with ES2015 concepts like computed keys, arrow functions, and template literals.\nIn this tutorial, we're going to create two JavaScript classes: User and Blog, and five files: schema.js, queries.js, mutations.js, middleware.js, and the index.js entry file.

Define your business-logic layer","keywords":"","body":"Define your business logic layer\nMicrograph is relatively un-opinionated in regards to your business logic layer. In most cases, Micrograph can simply hook into your existing logic without excessive coupling.\nFor this tutorial, we're going to create two classes: User and Blog classes.\nUser\n// User.js\nimport Blog from './Blog';\n\n// pretend database service\nimport db from '../db';\n\n// pretend auth function\nfunction checkCanSee(args, ctx) {\n  return true;\n}\n\nexport default class User {\n  constructor(data) {\n    this.id = data.id;\n    this.name = data.name;\n    this.email = data.email;\n  }\n\n  // factory function that performs basic auth (visibility)\n  static gen(args, ctx, data) {\n    return checkCanSee(args, ctx) ? new User(data) : null;\n  }\n\n  // fetches a single user in the db\n  static async findOne(args, ctx) {\n    const data = await db.user.findOne(args.id);\n\n    if (!data) return null;\n    return User.gen(args, ctx, data);\n  }\n\n  // fetches all users from the db\n  static async findAll(args, ctx) {\n    const data = await db.user.findAll();\n\n    if (!data) return [];\n    return data.map(d => User.gen(args, ctx, d));\n  }\n\n  // creates a user in the db\n  static async create(args, ctx) {\n    const data = await db.user.create(args.input);\n\n    if (!data) return [];\n    return User.gen(args, ctx, data);\n  }\n\n  // updates a user in the db\n  static async update(args, ctx) {\n    const data = await db.user.update(args.id, args.input);\n\n    if (!data) return [];\n    return User.gen(args, ctx, data);\n  }\n\n  // fetches the blogs that belong to a user instance\n  blogs(args, ctx) {\n    const data = await db.blog.findAll({ author: this.id });\n\n    if (!data) return [];\n    return data.map(d => Blog.gen(args, ctx, d));\n  }\n}\n\nThe above class is a unit of business-logic. The class structure is borrowed from Dan Schafer's talk regarding GraphQL at Facebook. Sashko Stubailo from the Apollo core team wrote an excellent overview.\nThe basic idea is that your models should be responsible for their own visibility and CRUD operations. You'll notice that the above class has virtually no coupling with Micrograph. The only caveat is that Micrograph expects your classes to have instance methods for resolving relationships, and it expects those methods to take in an args object as the first argument and a ctx object as the second argument. In Dan's talk, he says Facebook uses a viewer object in place of ctx, but the concept is the same. In your Micrograph application, you can create a universal ctx object that is passed around your business-logic layer. This object can include useful things, such as a JWT token that your models use to determine visibility.\nThe static methods aren't required, but are certainly good practice because they ensure that any user instance that exists in your application has been properly authenticated. The number and structure of the static methods are left to the developer. As you'll see in a little, we'll use these static methods when defining Micrograph's root queries and mutations.\nBlog\nThe Blog class has the same structure.\n// Blog.js\nimport User from './User';\n\n// pretend database service\nimport db from '../db';\n\n// pretend auth function\nfunction checkCanSee(args, ctx) {\n  return true;\n}\n\nexport default class Blog {\n  constructor(data) {\n    this.id = data.id;\n    this.title = data.title;\n    this.content = data.content;\n    this.authorId = data.authorId;\n  }\n\n  // factory function that performs basic auth (visibility)\n  static gen(args, ctx, data) {\n    return checkCanSee(args, ctx) ? new Blog(data) : null;\n  }\n\n  // fetches a single user in the db\n  static async findOne(args, ctx) {\n    const data = await db.blog.findOne(args.id);\n\n    if (!data) return null;\n    return User.gen(args, ctx, data);\n  }\n\n  // fetches all blogs from the db\n  static async findAll(args, ctx) {\n    const data = await db.blog.findAll();\n\n    if (!data) return [];\n    return data.map(d => User.gen(args, ctx, d));\n  }\n\n  // creates a blog in the db\n  static async create(args, ctx) {\n    const data = await db.blog.create(args.input);\n\n    if (!data) return [];\n    return User.gen(args, ctx, data);\n  }\n\n  // updates a blog in the db\n  static async update(args, ctx) {\n    const data = await db.blog.update(args.id, args.input);\n\n    if (!data) return [];\n    return User.gen(args, ctx, data);\n  }\n\n  // fetches the blog's author\n  author(args, ctx) {\n    const data = await db.blog.findOne(this.authorId);\n\n    if (!data) return [];\n    return User.gen(args, ctx, data);\n  }\n}\n\nThe above classes make up the entirety of our example app's business-logic layer. There is a decent amount of boilerplate among these two classes, but that's outside the scope of Micrograph. Remember, Micrograph only cares that your classes have instance methods that resolve relationships. The developer could very well create a base class that implements the static methods, as they're nearly identical. But, Micrograph aims to stay as far away from your business-logic layer as possible.\n"},"tutorial/define-the-schema.html":{"url":"tutorial/define-the-schema.html","title":"2. Define your schema","keywords":"","body":"Define the schema\nMicrograph uses the cohere schema lib. cohere is a tiny lib that compiles attributes and relationships to JSON that is easily transformed into a GraphQL schema, among other things.\nThe following is an example of a basic schema. Refer to the data modeling section for more information on creating schemas. We're using GraphQL scalar types for attributes.\n// schema.js\nimport Schema, { hasMany, belongsTo } from 'cohere';\nimport { GraphQLString, GraphQLNonNull, GraphQLList } from 'graphql';\nimport Blog from './models/Blog';\nimport User from './models/User';\n\nconst schema = new Schema();\n\nschema.defineType('user', {\n  attributes: {\n    name: GraphQLString,\n    email: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString),\n  },\n  relationships: {\n    blogs: hasMany('blog', 'author'),\n  },\n  model: User,\n});\n\nschema.defineType('blog', {\n  attributes: {\n    title: GraphQLString,    \n  },\n  relationships: {\n    author: belongsTo('user', 'blogs'),\n  },\n  model: Blog,\n});\n\nschema.compile();\n\nexport default schema;\n\ncohere offers three relationship types: hasMany, belongsTo, and hasOne. For each relationship, the first argument is the type that the relationship refers to, i.e. the user's blogs relationship points to the blog type. The second argument is the inverse field. For example, the schema above declares that the author relationship of a blog points to the user type and that the user type has a blogs relationship that points back towards the blog type.\nThe third argument is an optional object.\nAfter defining all your types, you must invoke the compile method, which simply links each relationship to each other. Compiling will let you know if you have any schema errors as well (such as a missing inverse or a relationship that points to an undefined type). This is useful becuase you'll never accidentally deploy a partially broken schema, which is really easy to do once your schema includes >20 types.\n"},"tutorial/root-queries-and-mutations.html":{"url":"tutorial/root-queries-and-mutations.html","title":"3.

The createInputObject function in the example maps a type's attributes into a GraphQL input object type, which is passed into args.input. inputObjectCache in the example is required so that multiple input object types of the same name are not created, otherwise GraphQL will throw an error.\nThe queries.js and mutations.js files are probably the most complex files in an entire Micrograph application, but they only need to be written once.

Micrograph requires that you use GraphQL scalar types for attributes, but if you choose to use cohere for a different project, you can use arbitrary typing (or none at all).\nnpm install --save cohere\n\nRelationships\ncohere is opiniated with relationships. It supports hasMany, belongsTo, and hasOne.\nhasMany(type, inverse, options)\nThe hasMany relationship is used for M:1 or M:N relationships. For example, a user might have many blogs. In another example, a teacher might have many students and vice versa.\nimport { GraphQLString } from 'graphql';\nimport Schema, { hasMany, belongsTo, hasOne } from 'cohere';\nimport { Blog, User } from './models';\n\nexport default new Schema()\n  .defineType('user', {\n    attributes: {\n      name: GraphQLString,\n    },\n    relationships: {\n      blogs: hasMany('blog', 'author', {...}),\n    },\n    model: User,\n  })\n  .defineType('blog', {\n    attributes: {\n      title: GraphQLString,\n    },\n    relationships: {\n      author: belongsTo('user', 'blogs', {...}),\n    },\n    model: Blog,\n  })\n  .compile();\n\nFor example, a GraphQL query might then look like:\nquery getUsersBlogs {\n  fetchUser(id: \"1\") {\n    name\n    blogs {\n      id\n      title\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nquery getBlogsAuthor {\n  fetchBlog(id: \"1\") {\n    title\n    author {\n      name\n    }\n  }\n}\nbelongsTo vs. hasOne\nBoth belongsTo and hasOne are for modeling 1:1 and 1:M relationships. In the example above, the blog type belongs to a user type via the author field.\nMicrograph will generate an author field on the Blog type that points to a User type.\nWhat's the difference between belongsTo and hasOne?\nNothing, really. They both represent 1:1 relationships, and cohere includes both mainly for use by the database layer. For example, we typically use belongsTo on a piece of data that we consider to be dependent. In other words, the existence of a blog depends on the existence of a user. A blog cannot exist without an author. In contrast, a user might have a company relationship:\n...\nrelationships: {\n  blogs: ...,\n  company: hasOne('company', 'employees', {...}),\n},\n...\n\nIn this example, it doesn't make sense for a user to belong to a company because a user might be unemployed.\nMicrograph handles belongsTo and hasOne relationships identically, and their use cases are left to the developer. For example, you might use belongsTo or hasOne to specify which table has the foreign key, how cascade deletion works, or which NoSQL collection has an index.\nResolving relationships\nMicrograph expects every model to have a corresponding instance method that matches the relationship's name. For example, if a user has many blogs, then the User class should have a blogs method.\nimport db from './database';\n\nclass User {\n  constructor(data) {\n    this.id = data.id;\n    this.name = data.name;\n    ...\n  }\n\n  blogs(args, ctx) {\n    return db.blogs.find({ author: this.id });\n  }\n}\n\nIf a schema type declares that it has a certain relationship, but the class does not have an instance method with a matching name, Micrograph will always resolve that relationship as null.\nOverriding a relationship's output type\nMicrograph creates a [Blog] type automatically for hasMany relationships. You can override the output, however. You can do things like have support Relay connections:\n// schema.js\n...\nschema.defineType('user', {\n  attributes: {\n    name: GraphQLString,\n  },\n  relationships: {\n    blogs: hasMany('blog', 'author', {\n      output: createConnectionType,\n    });\n  },\n});\n...\n\nYou can also transform the relationship data right in the schema without having to mess with your business-logic layer. So, if the User class's blogs method returns a normal array, you have an opportunity to transform it into the shape required by your output key:\n// schema.js\n...\nschema.defineType('user', {\n  attributes: {\n    name: GraphQLString,\n  },\n  relationships: {\n    blogs: hasMany('blog', 'author', {\n      output: createConnectionType,\n      transform: connectionFromArray,\n    });\n  },\n});\n...\n\nJust like root queries and root mutations, you can specify args for each relationship:\n// schema.js\n...\nschema.defineType('user', {\n  attributes: {\n    name: GraphQLString,\n  },\n  relationships: {\n    blogs: hasMany('blog', 'author', {\n      output: createConnectionType,\n      transform: connectionFromArray,\n      args: connectionArgs,\n    });\n  },\n});\n...\n\nThe blogs relationship is no longer a [Blog] type. It's now a BlogConnection type.
